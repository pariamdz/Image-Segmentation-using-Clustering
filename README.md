# Unsupervised Image Segmentation using Clustering!

Image segmentation is a crucial step in image processing and is essential for analyzing image contents. For instance, to determine if an indoor image contains a chair or a person, image segmentation can be used to isolate and examine each object individually. It typically precedes tasks like pattern recognition, feature extraction, and image compression.
Image segmentation involves classifying an image into various groups. Extensive research has been conducted in this field, particularly using clustering techniques. Among these, the K-Means clustering algorithm is one of the most widely used methods.
The process of image segmentation transforms an image into a set of pixel regions, represented by a mask or a labeled image. This segmentation allows for the targeted processing of significant image segments rather than the entire image.
In this section we want to demonstrate K-Mean able to cluster similar pixel properly. and finaly segment components of an image!
